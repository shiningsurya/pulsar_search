# Pulsar Search 
## Python scripts

The steps involved as of now.

- detect_blind
- detect_target
- prepare_prepfold

### detect_blind

For a given station and observing time, find all pulsars which can be detectable.


### detect_target

For a given station and observing time, for all the pulsars detectable find the rise and set times.


### prepare_prepfold

Given rise and set times, prepare stretches of data and prepare prepfold executables
